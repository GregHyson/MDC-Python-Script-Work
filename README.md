# MDC-Python-Script-Work
A range of python scripts created in order to ease workflow with the Water Services team at the Marlborough District Council.

These scripts were developed during my time working within the MDC both inside and outside of work hours.
At the time of starting my work with these scripts, my python knowledge was minimal to non existant, so these scripts
are liable to change should I stumble back into this repository with more experience under my belt.

The eventual implementation of the comtype module makes this a thoroughly more capable set of code.
Through the assistance of Alex Terenshkovs GitHub we have been able to get the comtypes module running
for python. Beyond that, two variations on a cleansing script were able to be implemented, allowing 
the scripts to meet two different teams specific requirements.
