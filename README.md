# MDC-Python-Script-Work
A range of python scripts created in order to ease workflow with the Water Services team at the Marlborough District Council.

These scripts were developed during my time working within the MDC both inside and outside of work hours.
At the time of starting my work with these scripts, my python knowledge was minimal to non existant, so these scripts
are liable to change should I stumble back into this repository with more experience under my belt.

After two weeks of work on the scripts mixed with my other jobs at the council, I am to be presenting a powerpoint trying to emphasize the importance and potential of these scripts. The content within the presentation is to be collated works from my two weeks and an effort to move communications regarding the future of the MDC's to the project board and GitHub in general.

One week later and I am starting to encounter gaps in the current implementation of Symbology and Field Aliases. This puts a large halt on alot of my work into the Layer Properties Tab and caused alot of frustration on my part. Each of the individual issues will be logged with ESRI and should they at some point in the future come out with a solution, these scripts will be revisitied.

By the next week considerable changes to the coding process had been put underway. I had discovered that certain base level functions cannot be completed by the base python scripting, and required the implementation of the comtype module. As such that week was spent trying to wrap my head around the comtypes mmodule in reference to my scripts. The results out of that week were 2 completely functional scripts combined into one, capable of correcting all the field aliases and fixing the visibility of the fields to not including the redundant info, all at a quicker pace than the prior implementation.
