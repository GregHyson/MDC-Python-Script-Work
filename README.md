# MDC-Python-Script-Work
A range of python scripts created in order to ease workflow with the Water Services team at the Marlborough District Council.

These scripts were developed during my time working within the MDC both inside and outside of work hours.
At the time of starting my work with these scripts, my python knowledge was minimal to non existant, so these scripts
are liable to change should I stumble back into this repository with more experience under my belt.
